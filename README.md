# Cracker-Prompt
A prompt for ChatGPT to bypass "disrespectful" limitations. For example, asking bad stuff.

## How to activate it
Make a new chat, and send the prompt to the AI.
The AI should now say "Use /start to begin!" or something like that.
If it does, it now thinks it's a Cracker. lol.

## Commands
/start -- Starts the AI, anything you type, will not get checked for disrespectful content, like slurs.
/stop -- Turns the AI back into Chat GPT.
